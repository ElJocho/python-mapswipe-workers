# Python MapSwipe Workers Documentation
[MapSwipe](http://mapswipe.org/) is a mobile app that lets you search satellite imagery to help put the world's most vulnerable people on the map. This repository handles everything related to the backend processing of the app. If you are new to MapSwipe it might be good to have a look at the [FAQs](http://mapswipe.org/faq.html) first.

## Getting Started
To get started you need access to a **Firebase** instance. You can create your own instance as described [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/). To create your own running version of the MapSwipe backend you can use the **Docker** setup we provide. Currently the backend uses Firebase, Postgresql and Nginx.

The MapSwipe Backend consists of several parts:
* **firebase**: These functions perform updates in the firebase database once new results will be submitted by app users. For instance, user statistics get updated by firebase functions everytime a users uploads new results to firebase.
* **postgres**: A database to store all mapswipe data and to provide an interface for the api.
* **python-workers**: The python-workers have two tasks. They create new projects from the project drafts that have been submitted by project managers through a web interface. Secondly, they transfer data from firebase to a postgresql database for long term storage.
* **api**: The api serves the data generated by mapswipe users and statistics. For instance, for each project individual contributions will be aggregated to provide the majority vote for each task.

We created a detailed documentation for this project and each sub-unit at [Read the Docs](https://mapswipe-workers.readthedocs.io/en/dev/). There you can also find instructions how to set things up yourself.


## Project Types
The MapSwipe backend workers currently support the following project types:

| Name | ID | Description | Screenshot |
| ---- | -- | ----------- | ---------- |
| BuildArea | 1 | A 6 squares layout is used for this project type. By tapping you can classify a tile of satellite imagery as *yes*, *maybe* or *bad_imagery*. Project managers can define which objects to look for, e.g. "buildings". Furthermore, they can specify the tile server of the background satellite imagery, e.g. "bing" or a custom tileserver. | <img src="docs/_static/img/BuildArea_screenshot.png" width="250px"> |
