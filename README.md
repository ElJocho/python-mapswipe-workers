# MapSwipe Back-End

[MapSwipe](http://mapswipe.org/) is a mobile app that lets you search satellite imagery to help put the world's most vulnerable people on the map. If you are new to MapSwipe it might be good to have a look at the [FAQs](http://mapswipe.org/faq.html) first.

The MapSwipe Back-End consists of a number of components:

1. Firebase Project
    - Firebase Realtime Database
    - Firebase Functions: These functions perform updates on data such as the progress of projects in the Firebase Database once new results will be submitted by app users.
2. MapSwipe Workers
    - The MapSwipe Workers create new projects from the project drafts submitted by project managers. 
    - The MapSwipe Workers transfer data from Firebase Database to a Postgres database for long term storage.
4. Postgres Database
    -  A database to store all data generated by MapSwipe. Used by the MapSwipe Workers.
3. Manager Dashboard
5. API

## Project Types

The MapSwipe backend workers currently support the following project types:

| Name | ID | Description | Screenshot |
| ---- | -- | ----------- | ---------- |
| BuildArea | 1 | A 6 squares layout is used for this project type. By tapping you can classify a tile of satellite imagery as *yes*, *maybe* or *bad_imagery*. Project managers can define which objects to look for, e.g. "buildings". Furthermore, they can specify the tile server of the background satellite imagery, e.g. "bing" or a custom tileserver. | <img src="docs/_static/img/BuildArea_screenshot.png" width="250px"> |
