# MapSwipe API documentation
## Intro
If you are new to MapSwipe it might be good to have a look at the [MapSwipe Data Model](mapswipe_data_model.md) first.
### File size
Since Mapswipe results are fairly large, we recommend minimizing the amount of requests you make to our API to save bandwidth costs. If we notice that your IP is making excessive use of our resources we will block your IP address. 

### Untouched data
This is RAW, UNPROCESSED data, meaning that you have to decide what is valid and invalid data. We simply provide users with a way to contribute, it is up to you which users to filter out. We provide the user_id property in results so you can ban users if you find results unacceptable. The user id will not change for a user, ever. In the future we will try to catch cheaters more effectively. 

### Tiles
We do not publish the tile URLs to avoid abuse at the moment. This may change in the future. If you want, you can always calculate the tile url based on the task x, y, and z, which correspond to tile x, y, and z on Bing. Make sure you ask Bing for your own API key.
