## Proposal for a new project type

The task would be to count the amount of buldings in one task.

We could use nearly the same setup as for the bulding area project type. 
Further we could use the results of the building area project type as input for this proposed project type.
The setup would be nearly the same. The interaction of the user would be different. We could use the taps as building count or some swipe interaction, like the user draws the number of buildings he/she spots with his/her finger.

Data could be used for dasymetric mapping method. It woulkd deliver more information about settlement structure and population density of course.
