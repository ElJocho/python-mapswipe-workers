# Diagrams

This document collects all diagrams associated with Mapswipe.

In the next MapSwipe version release (MapSwipe for Change Detection Analysis) those diagrams should be showing only the currently implemented structure and integrated with the docs in the appropriate places.

The Diagrams are drawn using [draw.io](https://.wwww.draw.io). You can download the `diagram.xml` file in the GitHub repository (docs/\_static/img/) and upload it to draw.io if you want to edit it
