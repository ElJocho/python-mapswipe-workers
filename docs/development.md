# Development

In this document some tips and workflows for development and hosting are loosely collected.


## Logging

Mapswipe workers logs are generated using the Python logging module of the standard library (See [Official docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) or this [Tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-logging/#the-logging-module). The configuration file of the logging module is located at `mapswipe_workers/logging.cfg`. With this configuration a logger object is generated in the `definitions` module (`mapswipe_workers.definitions.py`) and is imported in other modules to write logs.

```python
from mapswipe_workers.definitions import logger
logger.info('information')
logger.waring('warning')

# Include stack trace in the log
try:
    print(something)
except Exception:
    logger.exception('something')
```

Default logging level is Warning. To change the logging level edit the configuration (`mapswipe_workers/logging.cfg`).

Per default logging of third-party packages is disabled. To change this edit the definition module (`mapswipe_workers/defintions.md`). Set the `disable_existing_loggers` parameter of the `logging.config.fileConfig()` function to False.


## Database Backup

### Firebase

**Manual Backup**
- curl https://<instance>.firebaseio.com/.json?format=export
- ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27910784/is-it-possible-to-backup-firebase-db


### Postgres

**Manual Backup**
- Backup database in compressed splited files of specified size:
    - `pg_dump -U mapswipe -d mapswipe -h localhost -p 5432 | gzip | split -b 100m - mapswipe.pgsql.gz`
    - ref: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/backup-dump.html
- Copy the backup to your local machine when logged into your local machine:
    - `scp username@ipadress:mapswipe.pgsql.gz* /path/to/destination`
    - ref: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/106480/how-to-copy-files-from-one-machine-to-another-using-ssh
- Restore database backup from multiple compressed files
    - `cat mapswipe.pgsql.gz* | gunzip | psql -U mapswipe -d mapswipe -h localhost -p 5432`
